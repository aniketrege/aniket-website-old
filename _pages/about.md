I'm currently an MS EE student at the University of Washington, Seattle. I primarily spend my time as a graduate researcher in the RAIVN Lab mentored by [Aditya Kusupati](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kusupati/) and supervised by Prof. [Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/).

I recently completed a summer research internship in deep learning for autonomous vehicles at NVIDIA Redmond, supervised by Dr. [Nikolai Smolyanskiy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KxfefwgAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I worked for several years as a research engineer at Samsung Research India, working on perception problems for the AI Camera, including as a founding member of the [Single Take Camera](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-single-take-mode-on-samsung-phones) project, the USP of the Galaxy S20 flagship smartphone.

I am currently pursuing research in large-scale visual representation learning and web-scale image retrieval, with additional interests in learning from minimal supervison, and model robustness to real-world distribution shifts.
